def run_agent(user_message: str, history: list) -> str:

    Run the plant care agent for one user turn and return its response.

    TODO — Milestone 2:

    The agent loop follows a specific pattern that you'll implement here. Read
    specs/agent-loop-spec.md carefully before writing any code — understand the
    full loop before implementing any part of it.

    The loop works like this:
      1. Build a messages list: system prompt + conversation history + new user message
      2. Call the LLM with messages and TOOL_DEFINITIONS
      3. If the response contains tool_calls:
           a. Append the assistant message (with tool_calls) to messages
           b. For each tool call: execute via dispatch_tool(), append the result
           c. Call the LLM again with the updated messages
           d. Repeat until no more tool_calls (or MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS is reached)
      4. Return the final text response

    Key details to get right:
      - The assistant message must be appended BEFORE tool results
      - Tool result messages use role="tool" with a tool_call_id field
      - Append the assistant's message object directly (not just its content)
      - The history format from Gradio: list of [user_message, assistant_message] pairs

    Before writing code, complete specs/agent-loop-spec.md.

    # a list of {"role", "content"} dicts. (Older type="tuples" gives [user,
    # assistant] pairs.) Handle both so the agent works regardless of UI config.
